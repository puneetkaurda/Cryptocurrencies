# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment by using clustering and unsupervised machine learning.

## Results
The K-means algorithm is used to create an elbow curve plot. This allowed us to find the best value for k, and thus the best number of clusters for the available data.

# Summary
Plotting the scatter plot from two cryptocurrency features directly does not efficiently segregate the different classes. Therefore, using the PCA algorithm is the correct choice for visualizing the data.
